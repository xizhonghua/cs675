A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) helps searching for
a file efficiently with a keyword in peer-to-peer (p2p) networks. Those
DHT-based p2p networks are referred to as structured p2p networks. On 
the contrary, unstructured p2p networks use flooding or a central server
for search. Structured p2p networks offer more scalable, efficient,
and robust search and management. CAN, Pastry, and Chord are a few
examples of the structured p2p networks. You will implement
a CAN p2p system in this project. For implementation, you are free to use 
one of Java, C or C++, and any networking techniques including
sockets, RPC and RMI.

The paper below describes the details of the CAN protocol. You should
first read the paper VERY carefully, and understand it completely.
Feel free to read any related documents (except its implemented program). 
You can find the paper easily through Google. You can also download
the paper by clicking on the title below.

</li></ul>

After reading the paper, you should be able to answer the following
questions:
<ol>
<li> How does a node insert and retrieve a file with a keyword?
</li><li> How is a search query routed from source to destination?
</li><li> How does a new peer join CAN? Specifically, how does CAN compute 
the zone of the new peer? Who are the neighbors of the new peer?
</li><li> How does a peer leave CAN? Specifically, how is CAN reorganized
after node departures?
</li></ol>
You need to focus on Section 2 and Figures 1-3 to answer these questions.
For simplicity, you assume that nodes and networks do not fail; hence,
you do not need to implement the CAN recovery mechanism.

Your program is to support <b>the four main features: 1)</b> the file insert
and retrieve algorithm, <b>2)</b> the routing mechanism, <b>3)</b> the node join and
leave protocol, and <b>4)</b> displaying peer information. Of course, you are
always welcome to add more functionalities either explained in the paper
or your own ideas. In such a case, be sure to specify clearly in your README. Additionally, one peer needs
to be designated as the bootstrapping server that helps a new node join
the CAN network successfully. As discussed in the paper, the server
randomly chooses the coordinate of the new node and routes a join request
to this target peer. A new node can use any
active peer as the bootstrapping server. <br><br>

You will use a two-dimensional coordinate space (like a square) for this 
project. The side-length of this square is 10, and the number of peers
in the experiment is no greater than 10. To determine a mapping point
in the coordinate space, you will use a simple modulo-based hash function.
Specifically, the x-coordinate of a keyword (a string) is computed as
<i>CharAtOdd mod 10</i>, where <i>CharAtOdd</i> is the addition of the 
character values at odd positions. The y-coordinate of the keyword is
computed similarly, which is <i>CharAtEven mod 10</i> where <i>ChatAtEven</i>
is the addition of the character values at even positions. Note that
a floating-point number can be used for the coordinates for accurate
zone splitting. Assume that keywords have at least 5 characters.
<br><br>

When a node joins, if its zone is a square, then split the zone vertically
(this will give the node a rectangle zone). If the zone is a rectangle
with height greater than width, split the zone horizontally (this will
give the node a square zone). When a node leaves, search its neighbors
and merge its zone with a neighbor zone if that merge creates a
rectangle or square zone. Otherwise, the neighbor with the smallest
zone owns the zone of the departing node temporarily.
<br><br>

Once your CAN has started correctly, your program is to accept the
commands listed below:<br><br>
<table border="">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>insert <i>keyword</i> </code></td>
    <td>Insert a file with <i>keyword</i> starting from <i>peer</i>,
    where <i>peer</i> is a node identifier, not an IP address. 
    After a successful insertion, display which peer stores the file and
    the route at the IP layer from <i>peer</i> to the destination peer. 
    If the insertion fails, display "Failure".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>search <i>keyword</i> </code></td>
    <td>Search for a file with <i>keyword</i> starting from <i>peer</i>,
    where <i>peer</i> is a node identifier, not an IP address. 
    After a successful search, display which peer stores the file and
    the route at the IP layer from <i>peer</i> to the destination peer.
    If the search fails, display "Failure".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>view </code></td>
    <td>Display the information of a specified peer <i>peer</i> where
    <i>peer</i> is a node identifier, not an IP address. The information 
    includes the node identifier, the IP address, the coordinate, a list
    of neighbors, and the data items currently stored at the peer.
    If no <i>peer</i> is given, display the information of all currently
    active peers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>join </code></td>
    <td>A new node <i>peer</i> joins the CAN network. After a successful
    join, display the peer information (see view <i>peer</i>).
    If the join fails, display "Failure".
    If no <i>peer</i> is given, all the hosts join the CAN one after another.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>leave </code></td>
    <td>A node <i>peer</i> leaves the CAN network. After a successful leave,
    display the information at affected peers (neighbors). If the leave
    If the leave fails, display "Failure".</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

All the error cases and exceptions should be handled properly. This means
your system should not crash abruptly. As long as
the minimum requirements (the four main features) are met, the project
specifications can be flexible. New ideas, possible extensions, and other
suggestions are always welcome.
