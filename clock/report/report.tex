\section{Design}
\subsection{Language Choice}
I choose python to implement the simple clock synchronization protocol. Mainly because python has native support for UDP socket programming, also python supports multiple platforms.
\subsection{Timeout Threshold}
Packet timeout threshold was set to 5 times of the average round trip time (10ms in current implementation) between client and server.
If a packet arrived after timeout, that packet will be dropped and regarded as a failure.
 
\section{Implementation}
Both client and server are implemented in python.

\subsection{Compile}
No compilation required.
\subsection{Run}
Start the server: \\
\$ ./server.py \\
Start the client: \\
\$ ./client.py server\_address


\section{Results}

\subsection{Setup}
Server: medusa-node1.vsnet.gmu.edu \\
Client: pearl.vsnet.gmu.edu (NTP turned off)\\
Running period: 24 hours

\subsection{Average Round Trip Time}
Average round trip time: 2.102ms

\subsection{Packet Loss Rate}
Request sent: 8533 \\
Response received: 8317 \\
Packet loss rate: 2.53 \%

\subsection{Average Clock Drift Rate}
Fit a linear model between {\it offset} and {\it elapsed time} \\ 
Average clock drift rate =  $-24.316 \times 10^{-6}s/s$

\end{figure}

\subsection{Histogram of Instantaneous Clock Drift Rate}
The shape is a mixture of gaussian distribution with one mean at $-25 \times 10^{-6} s/s$, one mean at $-42 \times 10^{-6} s/s$ and one mean at $-8 \times 10^{-6} s/s $. The middle is the main component which is the normal case with a normal distribution. The rest of two small components are due to server load and client load, context switch, thus the estimation of round trip and offset has a non-zero mean error.
The left component is due to server load/context switch, the right component is due to client load/context switch.
